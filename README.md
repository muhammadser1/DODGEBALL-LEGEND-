## Week 1:

## Week 2:
1.	Learn how to download and use Unity.  – 1 hour
2.	Create a battlefield map in Unity. – 1 hour
3.	Program player movements in Unity, including features like dash speed and crouching. 2.5 hour
4.	Create a simple enemy and program it to chase the player when they are within a certain distance. – 1.5 hour
5.	Load a ball from Unity assets and program the functionality for picking it up('F') and throwing it ('G') directly towards where the camera is looking. – 2.5 hour
Total hours: 8.5

## Week 3:
1.	Fix the bug where the enemy falls down by implementing a solution that keeps the enemy standing at all times.
2.	Add a health bar to both the enemy and player characters.
3.	When the ball hits the player or enemy, decrease the health points by 10.
4.	Add an item that restores the player or enemy's health by 10 points when picked up.

## week 4:
Unable to make any progress due to other commitments.

## Note:
(Unfortunately, I encountered a bug when pushing some files to the repository. Despite my efforts, I was unable to fix it, possibly due to importing some files from Unity assets. As a solution, I have decided to create a new project without importing any files from Unity.)
